What We Are Doing
----
Cal Blueprint is creating an Android application to replace the organization's currently inefficient and insecure paper filing system. The goal is to help the organization save resources, improve data integrity, and make their process more streamlined and secure. The application will fully digitize all transactions at events, provide direct storage of client information into Salesforce, enable tracking of services via QR code scanning, and allow for the organization to move to a data-driven approach of service-providing.
